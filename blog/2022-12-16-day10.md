What a class! For my final blog post from Intro to Programming at Progressive, I am just going to share my notes from today. The huge amount of material we have learned over the last two weeks makes it hard to identify key takeaways, but I would say that overall, I feel more confident and prepared to continue developing in my role after taking the class. Thanks Jeff!

    - VM/OS
    - hypervisor
    - underlying hardware
    - Linux 
        - "User Land" = the part of Linux that the user interacts with
        -Linux kernel = the part that gets access to the underlying hardware
            - can access networks, read/write to the file system, etc.
        - namespaces
            - where user land applications can run
            - can have restrictions and limitations on them
    - Docker
        - if you have a Linux kernel as part of the deployment of your application, Docker lets you create a file with everything your application requires (Docker file) that will help with deployment
        - container runtime
    - Microsoft owns and maintains a Linux kernel known as the Windows Subsystem for Linux
    - containers and terms
        - Docker Desktop (and alternatives)
            - a piece of software that can be run on Windows, Mac, OS... anywhere with the Linux kernel
                - gives you a graphical user interface (GUI)
            - helps automate the process with Linux namespaces
        - Docker CLI
            - the command line interface provides the "docker" command and uses an API exposed by the "docker daemon"
            - see the processes that are running with ~$ docker ps
        - container image
            - the set of layers that make up what you need to run a piece of software using Docker
            - just the software, its environment and all the dependencies bundled together
        - container
            - a running instance of a container image
            - a program on the hard drive is to a running program as a container image is to a container
        -Dockerfile
            - a file that by convention is called "Dockerfile"
            - this has the instructions for creating our container image
        - build
            - the process of taking a Dockerfile and creating a container image
            - uses the Dockerfile
        - volumes
            - a way to redirect read and write operations inside the container to outside locations
        - tag
            - a name for a container image
            - often contains a version
        - repository
            - a group of related container images
            - can have multiple versions or targeted platforms
        - registry 
            - a service that stores docker container images
            - Docker Hub is the default, but also available at Google, Microsoft, Github, etc.
            - internally, a company will have a container registry
        - compose
            - a tool for running multiple containers on a machine as a set of related containers
            - Jeff uses this sometimes for developer environments
        - multi-stage build
            - using multiple staged containers as part of the build process to deliver the smallest, least exposed container ("final") to the registry
        - environment variables
        - requests and limits (memory/cpu)
    - kubernetes
        - a pronunciation of the Greek word cybernetics, sometimes abbreviated K8S
        - it's about a cluster (the ability to treat x number of computers as if it were just one)
        - cluster is made up of nodes
            - a node is a computer in the cluster (it can be a real computer or a VM)
            - there are two kinds of nodes in kubernetes
                - control plane
                    - responsible for running the cluster
                    - uses an API
                        - HTTP (rest) API
                            - kubctl
                        - database (etcd) "desired state"
                        - scheduler
                            - watches the database, makes the actual state match the desired state
                - worker nodes
                    - run our containers (workloads)
                    - the unit of deployment is a "pod" (called that because a group of whales is a pod and Docker's logo is a whale)
                        - a pod is one or more containers that are scheduled to a single node
                        - virtual localhost
                    - we describe a thing called a deployment
                        - creates the pod
                        - creates the actual deployment
    - in summary, kubernetes helps large teams of developers deploy software without getting in each other's way
