The first day of the Intro to Programming at Progressive course opened with a brief history lesson about the .NET framework and the C# language. Although I learned how to program in C# at the bootcamp program I attended, I was unaware of the strategic business reasons that led Microsoft to develop the language, as well as the various improvements that were made through the years.

We followed the history lesson with an introduction to Visual Studio, using a simple command line application to familiarize ourselves with the features. Although I have used Visual Studio in the past, we discussed several shortcuts I didn't know about -- specifically, I think control+F5 will save a lot of time in the future.

Another topic I learned about for the first time today was the Common Language Runtime, which is used to run our .NET applications. I knew runtimes existed and made an educated guess about what they were used for, but had never learned about the CLR specifically and definitely would not have recognized the acronym had I seen it in the wild.

Going forward in the course, I hope to continue getting more comfortable working with APIs, such as the one we created and tested in Postman today. This API took in an integer (minutes) representing the length of a break, and it returned the time when the break would be over.
