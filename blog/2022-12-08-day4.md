Day 4 of class started with a look at several strategies for writing loosely coupled code. Jeff walked us through some of the popular ways of thinking about this, including CUPID, the Four Rules of Simple Design and the SOLID principles. I will attach my notes on each of these below:

	- CUPID (Dan North)
		- composable
			- prefer composition over inheritance
			- lots of little pieces working together for a requirement
			- plays well with others
			- emphasize encapsulation
			- design of your programmatic interface (the description of what is does) is the primary thing, while the implementation is important but secondary
		- unix philosophy
			- small, focused bits of functionality
			- better to have a bunch of small tools that can work together than one big one that does everything
		- predictable
			- follows the "principle of least surprise" -- does what you think it will do
		- idiomatic
			- feels natural
			- use the language, idioms and conventions of that language
				- naming conventions, where you put the curly braces, etc.
		- domain based
			- be skeptical when you are spending more time solving technical requirements than business requirements
			- pick tools, frameworks, runtimes, etc. that take the technical requirements away from your abaility to fulfill business requirements
	- Four Rules of Simple Design (Kent Beck, Martin Fowler)
		1. passes all the tests
		2. reveals intention (the most important thing -- duplicate a ton of stuff if it makes the test more understandable)
		3. no duplications
		4. fewest elements (the fewer decisions, variables and loops you have, it is less likely you will have bugs
		- "don't repeat yourself" (DRY)
	- SOLID (Distillation of stuff, "codified" by Robert C. Martin)
		- single responsibility principle (SRP)
			- code modules should have a single axis of change
		- open/closed principle
			- code modules should be open for extension but closed for modification
			- find ways to make it so you rarely have to change existing code; instead, you have way to add new behavior and functionality by adding new stuff
		- Liskov substitution principle
			- derived types should be substitutable for their base types
			- prefer composition over inheritance
		- interface segregation principle
			- depend on small, client specific interfaces
		- dependency inversion principle
			- depend on abstractions, not concretions
			- our bank account app relies on a "what," not a "how" (the bonus calculation)
			- "new is glue"

As we continued learning about software testing, we looked at the definitions and examples of static testing, unit testing, integration testing and end-to-end testing. We discussed the different modes of using test doubles, and I will paste my notes on that here:

	- dummies - almost don't even count. they don't have anything to do with testing, which is why we mostly use them when we are testing something that doesn't have anything to do with the
	- stubs - for "state based" testing (Beckian Testing), your dependency is something you ask or query things of and it changes your state based on the response
	- mocks - for interaction testing ("mockist" or "London school") whish is "tell, don't ask"
	- fakes - replace a real but expensive thing for testing purposes, like using a fake database or something -- only used in integration testing

Day 4 of the course ended with a deeper look at C# syntax, including how to make a type nullable using a question mark. We also discussed properties, which we learned imply no computation and should never throw exceptions. If a user sets a property, it should never change until they change it.

One of the last subjects we covered on Day 4 was method overloading, which is when methods in a class have the same name but take a different number, order or type of parameters. This is not the same as overriding -- that is when you inherit from a class and change the behavior of a method.
