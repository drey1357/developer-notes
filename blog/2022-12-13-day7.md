We continued developing our Angular application today, already the seventh day of the Intro to Programming at Progressive course. As we went deeper into development, we ran into several subjects that will be important to know about in the future.

First, we learned about request validation and the difference between authentication and authorization. Authentication deals with figuring out who the user is, while authorization asks whether the user is allowed to perform the action they are trying to do. This is often accomplished using a JSON web token that is sent along with the user's request.

We also learned about IEnumerable, as well as route constraints and linting. We discussed the difference between FirstAsync, which returns the first thing, and SingleAsync, which expects exactly one thing to be returned and will throw an exception otherwise.

Something I had never seen before is the idea of union types. In Typescript, we learned that it is possible to make multiple types acceptable for a single variable, such as allowing a phone number to be either a string or number with code like "let phoneNumber: string | number".
