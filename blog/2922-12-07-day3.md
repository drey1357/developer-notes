Wow! We covered a lot of material today and I will admit that it was overwhelming at times. Continuing with the bank account application we started on Tuesday, we wrote more unit tests and introduced concepts like "dummy" and "stubbed" classes for testing. A stub is similar to a canned response to questions.

We had further discussions about the benefits of unit testing, learning that unit tests force loose coupling. Beyond unit testing, we learned that integration tests are used for situations where a developer needs to test more than one unit at a time.

Jeff shared some of the "programmer wisdom" he has picked up through the years, and I am attaching my notes on that below:

	1. make invalid states impossible
	2. write your code in such a way that after it ships, it doesn't have to be modified again
		- why? we are so much more likely to introduce bugs into code when we are making changes
		- sometimes referred to as the "open/closed" principle -- code should be open for extension but closed for modification
	3. variables in .NET cannot change their type
	4. inheritance is often called for in frameworks or UI libraries
	5. prefer composition over inheritance

Feedback loops were also discussed today, and I will also attach my notes on that subject:

	- inner loop
		- everything that you do on your machine while you write code
		- this means we intentionally set up our environment and choose the tools that are going to give us the most amount of "feedback" about how our work is going as quickly as possible
	- outer loop
		- everything that happens after we push our code to the repository
